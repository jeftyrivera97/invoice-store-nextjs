```

## 🔄 Development Process & Patterns

### React Patterns & Hooks Implementation
- **Custom Hooks** - Business logic abstraction and reusability
- **useState & useReducer** - Local component state management
- **useEffect** - Side effects and lifecycle management
- **useCallback & useMemo** - Performance optimization
- **useContext** - State sharing across component tree
- **Controlled Components** - Form input management
- **Compound Components** - Complex UI component patterns
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** - Component logic sharing
- **React.memo** - Component rendering optimization

### Code Organization
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI elements
- **Custom hooks** for business logic abstraction
- **Helper functions** for data processing and formatting
- **Type definitions** for consistent data structures

### Performance Optimizations
- **Server-side rendering** for initial page loads
- **Client-side state** for interactive operations
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Lazy loading** for large datasets

### Error Handling & Validation
- **Comprehensive error boundaries** with user-friendly messages
- **Form validation** with real-time feedback
- **API error handling** with proper HTTP status codes
- **Type safety** throughout the application stack

## 🎯 Business Logic Implementation

### Invoice Workflow
1. **Product Selection** - Search by code with real-time lookup
2. **Quantity & Pricing** - Dynamic calculations with tax inclusion
3. **Client Assignment** - Customer information integration
4. **Payment Processing** - Multiple payment method support
5. **Document Generation** - PDF invoice creation

### Automated Features
- **Product code generation** using business name initials + random numbers
- **Tax calculations** based on product categories
- **Currency conversion** with real-time exchange rates
- **Inventory updates** upon invoice completion

## 🚀 Deployment & Production
- **Vercel deployment** with automatic CI/CD
- **Environment-specific configurations** for development/production
- **Database migrations** managed through Prisma
- **Performance monitoring** and error tracking

## 📈 Key Achievements
- **Type-safe** end-to-end development reducing runtime errors
- **Responsive design** supporting desktop and mobile workflows
- **Real-time operations** with optimistic UI updates
- **Scalable architecture** supporting multiple business locations
- **Modern development practices** with proper testing and validation

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### React Hooks & State Management
```typescript
// Custom Hook Example - useInvoiceStore
const useInvoiceStore = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const state = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.invoice);
  
  const fetchProductoByCodigo = useCallback(async (codigo: string) => {
    // Complex async operations with error handling
  }, [dispatch]);
  
  return { ...state, fetchProductoByCodigo };
};

// Component State Management
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  descripcion: "",
  precio: 0,
  // ... other fields
});

// Effect for side effects
useEffect(() => {
  // Currency rate updates, API calls
}, [dependencies]);
```

### React Component Patterns
```typescript
// Controlled Components
<Input
  value={formData.descripcion}
  onChange={(e) => handleInputChange("descripcion", e.target.value)}
  placeholder="Product description"
/>

// Compound Components with Context
<Select value={selectedValue} onValueChange={handleChange}>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select option" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="option1">Option 1</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>

// Memoized Components for Performance
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{/* Complex rendering logic */}</div>;
});
```

### Advanced React Features
```typescript
// Suspense for Data Fetching
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <ProductList />
</Suspense>

// Error Boundaries
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Error handling for component tree
}

// Context for State Sharing
const InvoiceContext = createContext();
const InvoiceProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // Shared state logic
};
```

### Custom Hooks Implementation
```typescript
// useInvoiceStore - Complex state management
- Product lookup and validation
- Multi-currency calculations
- Real-time totals computation
- Error handling and user feedback
```

### Server Actions Pattern
```typescript
// Modern form handling without traditional API routes
- Direct database operations
- Automatic revalidation
- Built-in CSRF protection
- Progressive enhancement
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Reusable, type-safe components
- Form components with validation
- Data tables with sorting/filtering
- Modal dialogs with context
- Loading states and error boundaries
```
